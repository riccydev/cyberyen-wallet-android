## Easy and secure
Cyberyenwallet is the best way to get started with Cyberyen. Our simple, streamlined design is easy for beginners, yet powerful enough for experienced users. This is a free app produced by the Cyberyen Foundation.

## Donations
The Cyberyenwallet Team is a group of global volunteers & part of the Cyberyen Foundation that work hard to promote the use of Cyberyen. Cyberyenwallet takes a lot of time and resources to improve and test features but we need your help.  Please consider donating to one of our addresses:

## Completely decentralized

Unlike other Android Cyberyen wallets, **Cyberyenwallet** is a standalone Cyberyen client. It connects directly to the Cyberyen network using [SPV](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Thin_Client_Security#Header-Only_Clients) mode, and doesn't rely on servers that can be hacked or disabled. Even if Cyberyenwallet is removed from the App Store, the app will continue to function, allowing users to access their valuable Cyberyen at any time.

## Cutting-edge security

**Cyberyenwallet** utilizes AES hardware encryption, app sandboxing, and the latest Android security features to protect users from malware, browser security holes, and even physical theft. Private keys are stored only in the secure enclave of the user's phone, inaccessible to anyone other than the user.

## Designed with new users in mind

Simplicity and ease-of-use is **Cyberyenwallet**'s core design principle. A simple recovery phrase (which we call a paper key) is all that is needed to restore the user's wallet if they ever lose or replace their device. **Cyberyenwallet** is [deterministic](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0032.mediawiki), which means the user's balance and transaction history can be recovered just from the paper key.

## Features:

- ["simplified payment verification"](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0037.mediawiki) for fast mobile performance
- no server to get hacked or go down
- single backup phrase that works forever
- private keys never leave your device
- import [password protected](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0038.mediawiki) paper wallets
- ["payment protocol"](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0070.mediawiki) payee identity certification
